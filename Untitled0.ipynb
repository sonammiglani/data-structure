What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n","   - > NumPy arrays and Python lists are both used to store data, but they have several key differences that make them suited for different purposes. NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists because they are implemented in C and store data in a compact and uniform manner. While NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type, Python lists are heterogeneous and can hold elements of different types, such as numbers, strings, or objects. NumPy arrays excel in numerical and scientific computations, offering advanced functionality like element-wise operations, broadcasting, and support for multi-dimensional data, which Python lists lack. Additionally, NumPy arrays provide a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions out-of-the-box, whereas similar operations on Python lists require explicit loops or external libraries. In contrast, Python lists are more versatile and user-friendly for general-purpose programming due to their flexibility and ease of use for tasks that don't require heavy numerical computations.
